This project utilizes Spotify API to retrieve user information such as top tracks as well as features of each song. The recommendation system utilizes Spotify's API method for creating recommendations. The similarity score is then calculated between the inputted playlist and the recommended playlist. Once that is done the max similarity score of each song will be added into a final recommended playlist.
