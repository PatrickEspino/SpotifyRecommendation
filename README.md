# SpotifyRecommendation
This is a basic project for creating a playlist on Spotify based on another playlist.

# How It Works
The user will be asked to log in with their Spotify credientials. Then they will be authenticated using SPotify OAuth2.0 which will allow the app to read/write data to the user's Spotify Account.

The user will copy their playlist link and paste it into the app and a new playlist will be created with its chosen name.

The app will also be able to grab the top 50 tracks in the time range "short term" which will be based on the last month of listens.
